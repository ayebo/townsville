                <h1>Welcome To <br>Townsville Community Music Center!</h1>
                <h3></h3>
                <p>Based in Townsville, North Qld, the Music Centre presents concerts and workshops throughout the year,
                    in a diverse range of genres including classical, jazz, folk, blues, world and contemporary music,
                    featuring touring artists and locally-based professional and emerging artists.</p>
                <p>The Townsville Community Centre began in early 1983 when a group of people with a shared interest in
                    musical matters decided to address the local paucity in musical opportunities. An early objective of
                    the centre was to encourage the establishment of tertiary music education in Townsville, and provide
                    classes, courses, and workshops in a variety of musical styles, levels, instruments and experiences.
                </p>
                <p>The Centre ran a significant concert program for many years and promoted emerging musicians.
                    Reflecting the Centre's increasing workload as an information and referral service, this collection
                    includes documents on concerts, training, instruments, musicians, sheet music, performance and
                    rehearsal spaces, functions and events, sources for grants and funding, legal matters, continuing
                    professional development of local musicians, and integrating overseas professional musicians with
                    local community musicians. </p>
                <p>Townsville Community Music Centre is a not-for-profit, incorporated organisation serving musicians
                    and their audience in North Queensland. The Music Centre's role includes facilitation, presentation
                    and promotion of events, functions, education, workshops, concerts, festivals in Townsville, and
                    surrounding centres.</p>
                <p>Looking Back - The first 30 years!</p>
                <p>The Townsville Community Music Centre celebrated its 30th year in 2013.<br>
                    It has been constantly changing over the years to keep up to date with the musical tastes and needs
                    of the Townsville community. As part of the relocation of the Music Centre to the Civic Theatre,
                    Bronia Renison and Jean Dartnall, both librarians, have assessed the old collection of sheet music,
                    books and recorded music which the centre has been storing, unused, for many years. Sometimes older
                    things have to be discarded to make way for the new, but the Music Centre is aware that older
                    material may still have value.</p>
                <p>The National Library of Australia has an online catalogue (TROVE) that lists not only its own
                    holdings but also information about items held by many other libraries around Australia. Using this
                    catalogue Bronia and Jean have identified at least 150 items of music that are not held by any of
                    the country's major libraries. These items have been donated to the National Library to include in
                    their collection and thus made available to all historians and musicians.</p>
                <p>Also discovered in the old collection were some pieces relevant to North Queensland. Local musicians
                    performed these at a musical social afternoon on Sunday April 21st in C2 at the Civic Theatre. The
                    remaining sheet music, books and CDs were put on display and distributed free of charge to the local
                    music community.</p>
