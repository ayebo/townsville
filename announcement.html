                <p>Our Parish Priest, Fr Mick Peters, is trying to development and foster a community for our 6 PM Vigil
                    Mass at St Josephs on the Strand.</p>
                <p>I'm helping by organising an event format, where I invite our members to bring a plate for a buffet
                    and I provide music, or friends who can sing or perform.</p>
                <p>Now that we are achieving some success, we need more people who can sing or play music.</p>
                <p>I'm open to any kind of singing or performing so long as it is not too controversial. My preference
                    would be for an artist to sing a medley of old time favorites.</p>
                <p>Mass starts at 6pm and finishes about 10 to 7.</p>
